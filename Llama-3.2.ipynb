It is a good reminder for all of us to be happy.\\nThe key to life is to be happy. We are not here to worry, to be anxious, to be depressed, or to be unhappy. We are here to be happy. And if you have the ability to be happy, then you are happy. If you have the ability to be unhappy, then you are unhappy. The ability to be happy is the ability to be alive. If you are not happy, then you are not alive.\\nIn the past, happiness has been defined as being happy and being sad. But that’s not the way the word is used in our modern world. Happiness is not a feeling, it’s an emotion. It’s an attitude. It’s a state of mind. It’s a way of being. It’s a way of living.
